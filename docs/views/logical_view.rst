Logical view
============

GIS visualization can only be done if we have all GPS coordinates: it is not always the case.
Another way to visualize a network is use a graph drawing algorithm to display the network.

The logical view relies on the :guilabel:`D3.js` JavaScript library to display the network in a visually pleasing fashion.
