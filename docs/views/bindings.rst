Bindings
========

For both the geographical and the logical views, bindings are the following :

* :guilabel:`Left-click on a node`: selection of the node.
* :guilabel:`Double Left-click on an object`: open the property panel.
The property panel displays all properties of the object, and any property can be modified.
If the object is a node, it also contains a ``Connect`` button to automatically start an SSH to the device.
