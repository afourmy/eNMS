Script scheduling
=================

Sending a script is done from the graphical view of the network, in two steps:
    
1. Selecting the target devices
#. Scheduling the script

Target selection
----------------

To select the targets, you must press ``Shift + Left-click`` and draw a selection rectangle that contains all targets.
All selected devices will be highlighted in red. Pressing ``Right-click`` will automatically unselect all devices.
