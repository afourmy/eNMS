    <h2>Napalm Use Device Driver</h2>
    <p>When enabled, use the device driver specified for the device in the inventory.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it makes sense to override the inventory-specified device driver for a
      particular service. For example, a secondary/custom device driver exists for a
      particular function, or perhaps another device's driver supports a function better,
      which is the case for certain Cisco drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When switching to another device driver, the Close Connection or Start New Connection
      option needs to be used to consume and recreate the cached connection for this device.
